easycsv is a csv builder class that, as the name states, makes object-to-csv easy.

#### how to use

```java
Foo foo = new Foo();
foo.setA(1);
foo.setB(1.1);
foo.setC("bar");
String csv = EasyCSV.builder()
    .setSource(foo)
    .build();
```

#### output

```
A,B,C
1,1.1,bar
```

#### currently supported types

* all primitive/wrapper types.
* java.lang.String
* java.util.Date

#### supporting custom types

easycsv uses a registry class named FormatterRegistry which loads and manages the formatters. 

In order for it to load your custom formatter, 
you need to implement **FieldFormatter** and add a line with the package name to the service configuration file at *main/resources/dev.dules.FieldFormatter* (you can always fork this and change the resource file name). 

Ps: custom types have priority over primitive/wrapper types.
